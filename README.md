#### **Summary:**
This is a web application that is meant to visualize a data feed containing information
on malicious domains. The data feed used for this application is from Malware Domain List
(http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/). This data feed provides several columns of information
per malicious domain, one of which is the IP address that is associated with the domain.
The application uses an IP lookup API (currently using, https://extreme-ip-lookup.com), in
order to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates that represent the approximate
geo-location of each IP address. The geo-locations are visualized using an embedded Google Map,
and the data is visualized in a table underneath the map.

The user is able to search through the data via a search input field, as well as sort the
data in ascending or descending order of any of the columns in the data grid. The user
may also select/deselect individual rows from the data grid, which will cause the map to
show only the selected locations.

#### **Directories:**
1) malware_data_geolocations contains the front-end web application
2) api_service contains the back-end api service

#### **Instructions to run the application locally (these instructions assume npm is installed):**
1) Install Docker.
2) Clone the repository.
3) Open a terminal window and `cd` into the repository folder.
4) Run the command: `./start.sh` (it should take about 20 seconds for all of the dependencies to install).
5) Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

#### **Technologies used in building the application:**
  Front-end application: **React, Apollo Client**<br/>
  Back-end API service: **Node/Express, GraphQL, Sequelize**<br/>
  Database: **Postgres**<br/>
  **Docker** used for containerization of API and database<br/>
  **Jest** and **Enzyme** used for unit testing and integration testing<br/>
  **ESLint** (with AirBnb config) used for linting front-end code<br/>
  **Travis CI** used for continuous integration and build testing<br/>
