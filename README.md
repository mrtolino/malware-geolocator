#Malware Geolocator
###by Shant Simonian
----------------------

**Summary:**
This is a web application that is meant to visualize a data feed containing information
on malicious domains. The data feed used for this application is from Malware Domain List
(http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/). This data feed provides several columns of information
per malicious domain, one of which is the IP address that is associated with the domain.
The application uses an IP lookup API (currently using, https://extreme-ip-lookup.com), in
order to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates that represent the approximate
geo-location of the IP address. The geo-locations are visualized using an embedded Google Map,
and the data is visualized in a table underneath the map.

The user is able to search through the data via a search input field, as well as sort the
data in ascending or descending order of any of the columns in the data grid. The user
may also select/deselect individual rows from the data grid, which will cause the map to
show only the selected locations.
